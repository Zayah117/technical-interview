QUESTION 1
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Run a for loop that tests every possible spot that the substring could fit
within the main string. For example, if the substring is 3 letters in length,
I compare it against the main string in 3 letter chucks. 

E.g. main string='Udacity' and substring='aci'. 'Uda'->'dac'->'aci', here
at 'aci' the loop would return True. (In the code everthing is sorted alphabetically
to properly test for anagrams).

QUESTION 3
Time: O(nm)?
Space: O(n)

This is a greedy algorithm. It works by starting with an empty graph, S, and then adding on to S
until S has as many vertices as G. As the program loops, it finds the shortest edge that connects
a vertex of S to a vertex of G-S, and then adds the new 'short edge' and 'short vertex' to S.

QUESTION 4
Time: O(log n)
Space: O(log n)

First get all ancestors of n1 and n2, then compare ancestors in ascending order until a match is found.

QUESTION 5
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

First find the length of the list, then find the target node by moving to the 'list_length - m' position.
